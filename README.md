# Welcome to the Body Coach Test Task!

Clone this repository and commit your changes as you would normally. Once you've finished, you can either publish your changes to a public repository and send us the link to it or you can zip up the repository and send it to us directly.

The end result we would like to get is the following:

When you press Load Data, the app should fetch this week's Step data from the HealthKit and display it on the screen like the screenshot below:
<table>
<tr><td>
<img src="https://github.com/The-Body-Coach/bodycoach-ios-test-task/assets/26137569/8db6b2af-39df-4762-866d-a199dca23dff" width="300">
</td>
<td valign="top">
The numbers in the upper row should represent the day, and the numbers in the second row should be the number of steps you completed that given day.

  # Things to bear in mind

- Don't worry about the design too much, but try to make it as close to the screenshot as possible
- If there is anything you don't like in the original, please feel free to change it
- To load test data, open the Health App on the simulator (you might need to go through a quick set up), find steps (Browse tab, and there is a search), click Add Data from the top.
- Please don't spend more than 2 hours on this task, the aim here is to see how well we can work together and discuss ideas / feedback 
</td></tr></table>

Good luck, we are looking forward to discuss it with you on the next round!
